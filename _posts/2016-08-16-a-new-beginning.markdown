There comes a point in time when a person begins to wonder, or worry, about their position in life.  About their place in the world.  Perhaps there has been disappointment or delay, setbacks or suffering, that caused furtive contemplation; half a life lived, half a life to go, God willing.  

During these times a person may be tempted to partake of wild adventures, fits of lavish spending, or sudden career changes.  Being of average stock, I find myself in that situation.  However, not having the means to spend lavishly, I've decided instead to write.  

But simply writing, while a joy in and of itself, does not produce (unless wildly lucky and talented) resources sufficient for lavish spending, or any spending at all, which really is the point of discussing a mid-life crisis. 

Why not, then, combine writing with earning money?  The internet is full of apparent success stories, people who have transitioned from a career working for someone else to a career working for themselves.  It's a rosy picture, painted with flowery pastels and sparkling gold.  I'll bet dollars to donuts, however, that those who achieved success worked their tails off to win it. 

Therein lies the struggle, at least from my personal perspective.  These ideas float into the heads of many, myself included.  The excitement is palpable in the beginning; like the start of a race.  Over time, the excitement fades and the lack of dedication starts to show.  Time stretches between posts, other activities seem like more fun, and the idea eventually dies.  

How to prevent this?  Discipline?  Sticky notes placed on the bathroom mirror?  Calendar reminders every day?  I don't have a plan to overcome this, but perhaps here is the place to talk about it.  Let's find out.
