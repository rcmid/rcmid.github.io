Thanks to a bountiful harvest of tomatoes this year, I had the opportunity to can tomato salsa. Here's the recipe, courtesy of Sydney Dunlap.

<B>14 Cups Tomatoes, Diced & Drained Well<br>
2 1/2 Cups Diced Onion<br>
1 Cup Green Bell Pepper<br>
6 Diced Jalapeno Peppers<br>
1 1/2 Cups Chopped Cilantro<br>
2 Tablespoons White Vinegar<br>
2 Tablespoons Salt<br>
2 Tablespoons Crushed Red Pepper<br>
1 Teaspoon chili powder<br>
1 Tablespoon Corn Starch, dissolved in 1 Tablespoon water<br>
2 Limes, Juiced</B><br>

Tip: When cutting and seeding hot peppers, wear rubber gloves to prevent your hands from burning.

<I>Bring ingredients to a boil.  Simmer 10 minutes.  Ladle hot salsa into jars leaving 1/2 inch head space.  Remove air bubbles, wipe rims.  Apply lids and bands, tighten finger-tip tight and process for 15 minutes. 

Equals 7 pints with a little left over for tasting.
